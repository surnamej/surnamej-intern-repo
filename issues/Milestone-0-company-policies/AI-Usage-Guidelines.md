## Use of AI Tools

### Research & Learn

#### What AI tools are typically used for your role?

Common AI tools used in professional settings and my role which is front-end developer include:

- Content creation tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly) for writing, editing, and brainstorming ideas.
- Code Completion and Suggestion Tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) to assist in writing code faster and more accurately.
- UI/UX Design Assistance (e.g., Figma, Adobe XD with AI features) to help create designs with AI-generated suggestions or automate layout adjustments.
- Accessibility Tools (e.g., Axe, Lighthouse) that help ensure your website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
- Testing and Debugging Tools (e.g., Testim, CoTester by TestGrid ) to automate frontend testing, improve the reliability of your code, and spot potential issues faster.

#### What are the benefits and risks of using AI in a professional setting?

Benefits:

- AI tools can help autocomplete code, reducing manual effort and speeding up the development process.
- AI tools can help identify bugs early in the development cycle, improving the overall quality of your code.
- AI-powered design tools can make design suggestions, improving the visual experience and UI consistency.

Risks:

- Dependence on AI tools for code completion might make developers less familiar with coding from scratch, which can impact problem-solving and debugging skills.
- AI tools may inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities if not properly verified.
- Automated design suggestions might lack the nuances needed to create a truly inclusive and accessible experience.

#### What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?

- Sensitive Project Information as client project details, proprietary code, or sensitive algorithms should not be entered into AI tools that do not have a secure framework.
- Never input login credentials, API keys, or other sensitive tokens into AI tools, as this could expose them to security risks.
- Avoid entering any personal identifiable information (PII), such as user data or customer records, into AI tools.

#### How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?

- Run Tests: For AI-generated code, use automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) to check its functionality.
- Review Code and Design: Validate AI-generated UI/UX designs by testing them with actual users or reviewing them with the design team to ensure they meet accessibility standards.
- Cross-check Documentation: Compare AI suggestions with official documentation and code style guides to ensure adherence to best practices.
- Manual Code Review: Have peers review the code and design to catch potential errors and improve quality.

### Reflection

#### When should you use AI for assistance, and when should you rely on your own skills?

- Use AI for repetitive tasks like code generation, fixing syntax errors, or suggesting design improvements.
- Rely on your own skills for complex problem-solving, debugging, or understanding the underlying logic and user needs.
- Use AI when you need to increase productivity, but rely on your expertise when making architectural decisions, handling performance optimizations, or ensuring security.

#### How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?

- Use AI as a tool, not a crutch. Keep challenging yourself to write and debug code manually to maintain and improve your skills.
- Understand the code AI generates, rather than just copying and pasting it, so you can ensure its correctness and optimize it.
- Limit reliance on AI for tasks that require deep understanding, such as debugging complex issues or implementing new features.

#### What steps will you take to ensure data privacy when using AI tools?

- Avoid uploading sensitive or proprietary code to AI-powered tools, especially if those tools are cloud-based and may not comply with company privacy policies.
- Use secure AI platforms that adhere to industry standards for data protection and privacy.
- Verify the privacy policies of any AI tool you use, ensuring they comply with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
- Avoid storing sensitive information like passwords or API keys in AI-assisted environments.
