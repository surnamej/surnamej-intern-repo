## Cyber Security

### Research & Learn

#### What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?

Unsecured resident Wi-Fi networks are the first of the major cyber security issues. If they are not properly configured, they can be targeted, putting networks and company data at risk of compromise.  Second, using personal devices like laptops and smartphones to access work data can lead to security issues like compromised login credentials or unauthorized access to sensitive user data if those devices are not properly maintained.

#### What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?

Maintaining the security of our gadgets requires regular software updates and device regulation.  Furthermore, it is essential to back up our key files so that we can restore them in the event that we lose our data.  These days, we have a variety of options for creating backups, including physical media and the cloud.  Last but not least, antivirus software is an integrated application that guards our device by identifying and eliminating viruses.

#### Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?

It is crucial to protect our personal information including birthday, contact number, home address. Not locking our computers is like surrendering someone can access to our information easily.

#### How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?

I always ignore those of phishing emails or links, however, I just realized that we should report the phish to protect myself and others.

#### What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?

Your password should contain at least eight characters, a combination of capital and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.  Additionally, you should avoid using personal terms like your birthday or nickname.  A password manager helps us remember a master password, which reduces password fatigue, which is why I should use it.  Password managers will assist us in creating strong, one-of-a-kind passwords for our numerous online accounts and safely storing them in an encrypted digital vault.

#### Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?

Our door appears to be firmly locked with two locks.  Even if the hackers know our username and password, they are unable to access our account since they require a second authentication factor that is sent straight from the authenticator application.
