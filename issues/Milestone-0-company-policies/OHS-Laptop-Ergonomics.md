#### What are the risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard?

Because of the small size of computers, bad posture is a major issue.  Musculoskeletal problems like neck strain, upper back discomfort, and spinal misalignment will result from this issue.  Additionally, using a laptop for extended periods of time can cause eyestrain, weariness, dry eyes, and headaches due to its small screen size.

#### What ergonomic equipment can improve posture when working on a laptop? (e.g., laptop stands, external keyboards, ergonomic chairs)

- External Monitor to keep my screen at my eye level
- Ergonomic Chair that provides lumbar support and promotes healthy posture.
- Adjustable Portable Laptop Table Stand will allow us to adjust the height and angle of my laptop.

#### What adjustments should be made to monitor height, chair position, and desk setup for a healthier workspace?

- Set the display or laptop's height as close to eye level as possible, depending on the eyes sight condition.
- Adjust monitor distance to an arm's length based on screen size and eye comfort.
- Place keyboard and mouse on a flat surface 10-15cm from desk edge, keeping mouse parallel to keyboard to reduce shoulder discomfort.
- Wireless headsets or earbuds make it easier to work on our computers during phone calls; nevertheless, we should only use them when absolutely required because using headsets or earphones for an extended amount of time is bad for your ears.

#### What are some daily habits that reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use? (e.g., movement breaks, posture checks, eye strain reduction techniques)

To reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use, incorporating daily habits that focus on movement, posture, and eye care is essential.

- Take regular breaks: Aim to take a 5-10 minute break every 30-60 minutes. Use this time to stretch, walk around, or change positions. This helps reduce muscle stiffness and improves circulation.
- Check sitting posture every 30 minutes. Adjust chair and desk height if needed, and sit upright, not slouched.
- Every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and look at something 20 feet away. This reduces eye strain caused by focusing on a screen for long periods.

### Reflection

#### What equipment changes can you make to improve your workspace setup? (e.g., using an external monitor, adjusting your chair, using a laptop stand)

If I come to Monash Generator, I will definitely use an extra monitor that they provide for us, which is help me set the display close to my eye level.

#### What behavioural changes can you implement to improve posture and reduce strain? (e.g., sitting upright, taking regular breaks, adjusting screen height)

I will take a break regularly to rest my eyes, stay hydrated by drinking some water and stretch my body.

#### How can you remind yourself to maintain good posture and take breaks throughout the day? (Hint: Use Focus Bear to schedule movement breaks!)

I can utilize Pomodoro technique in Focus Bear application for focused work intervals, typically 25-30 minutes, followed by a 5-minute break. During your break, take a moment to correct your posture and stretch your body. After four Pomodoro sessions, take a longer break (15-30 minutes), allowing you to refresh, hydrate, and focus on body alignment.
