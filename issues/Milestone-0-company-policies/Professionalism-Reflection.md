## Professionalism at Focus Bear

### Research & Learn

#### What are examples of professional vs. unprofessional behaviour in a casual work environment? (Hint: Think about communication, meeting etiquette, and teamwork.)
- **Communication**
Professionals communicate clearly and concisely.  They must avoid using slang or jargon in order to respect their colleagues and customers.  However, unprofessional people may communicate in a verbose or unclear manner by using inappropriate language.
- **Appearance**
Meanwhile, professionals dress and groom themselves appropriately, whereas unprofessionals may dress inappropriately for the workplace and maintain poor hygiene. 
- **Behaviour**
Professionals are trustworthy and dependable.  They meet deadlines and arrive on time.  Unprofessional people, on the other hand, might be untrustworthy, arrive late for work, and cheat or lie in order to get promoted.
- **Work ethic**
Professionals are eager to go above and beyond to complete tasks, and they are constantly seeking to expand their knowledge and skill sets.  However, non-professionals might not want to improve their skills and be too lazy to put in the extra work.
- **Emotional control**
Under pressure, professionals are able to regulate their emotions.  Additionally, they stay clear of conflicts or arguments with their clients or coworkers.  People who lack professionalism could become easily angry or frustrated.  They might also be vindictive or gossipy.
