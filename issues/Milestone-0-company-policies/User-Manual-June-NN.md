## How I Work Best
- I do my best work when:
   - I don’t have too many workloads
   - I am well-rested and have free time to do whatever I want
   - I have clear priorities and minimal distractions
   - I have or am given deadlines
   - I understand the purpose of the task I’m doing
- I struggle when:
   - I get interrupted by unnecessary tasks
   - I get overlaid schedule
   - The work is reputative and boring
   - The problem is hard to figure out by myself
## Communication Style
- I prefer messages to be... 
   -  **Batched** – Instead of sending multiple short messages, group your questions/updates together to minimize interruptions
   - **Async First** – I don’t check emails and messages constantly, so I prefer asynchronous communication where possible. If you need a response by a certain time, mention that explicitly
   - **Structured** – If you’re sharing multiple points, bullet points or numbered lists help me process information faster
   - **Visual When Helpful** – If explaining something complex, screenshots, diagrams, or Loom videos can be more efficient than long text messages.
- The best way to reach me is:
   - For discussions that need more depth: Scheduled meetings
   - For questions that require me to take action but are not urgent: send an email or message via Discord
   - If you need something a bit more urgently but it can wait, send me a Discord message
- If you need something urgent, call me through Discord or my phone 0451 351 758
## Collaboration & Teamwork
- I work best in a team when:
   - I and my teammates are clear on goals and responsibilities
   - Other people get their work done on time as possible
   - Team members communicate openly and respectfully
- My biggest pet peeve in teamwork is:
   - Unnecessary meetings
   - People not following through on commitments
- If I seem quiet in a meeting, it usually means:
   - I’m processing information and thinking deeply
   - I need more context before I feel confident contributing
   - I might be tired or distracted, but I’m still listening
   - I’m coming up with ideas but need a moment to organize my thoughts before sharing
## Focus & Productivity
- I stay focused by
   - Listening any kind of songs
- Things that distract me:
   - Frequent notifications and unnecessary messages
   - Background noise
   - My exhaustion
- The best way to support my productivity is:
   - Let me know what’s most important so I can focus on high-impact tasks.
   - Sudden shifts can disrupt my workflow, so advance notice is appreciated.
## Feedback & Growth
- I like feedback to be:
   - Direct but kind, with specific examples
   - Private if it’s constructive, public if it’s positive recognition
- When I make a mistake, the best way to let me know is:
   - Send me a message privately with the issue and suggestions for improvement
- I appreciate it when teammates:
   - Share ideas and challenge my thinking
   - Communicate changes early
## Fun Facts & Quirks
- One thing people often misunderstand about me is:
   - I might look stressed or frustrated, but I’m just deep in thought, not upset.
   - I’m quiet in groups, but I’m very paying attention.
- A fun fact about me:
   - I am Pokémon merchandise lover, especially Gengar goods.
   - I’m a big fan of coffee, tea, and non-alcoholic beverages, so let’s catch up over a cup sometime!
- My work superpower is:
   - "I’m a binge thinker" – When a problem captures my attention, I will obsess over it and explore every angle.
