# Milestone: Working in an agile team
## Agile Ceremonies & Team Collaboration

## Research & Learn
#### What are the main Agile ceremonies, and what is their purpose?
1. Daily Stand-ups
   - A short (usually 15-minute) meeting where team members share updates on what they're working on, any blockers they're facing, and their plans for the day.
   - The goal is to keep the team aligned, identify obstacles early, and ensure continuous progress.
2. Sprint Planning (Scrum) vs. Continuous Prioritisation (Kanban)
   - In Sprint Planning (Scrum), the team plans the work for the upcoming sprint (Usually 1-4 weeks). They will break tasks into user stories and assign priorities.
   - In Continuous Prioritization (Kanban), tasks are continuously reviewed and prioritized based on business needs.
   - The purpose of these processes is to ensure that the team works on the most valuable tasks while balancing workload.
3. Retrospectives
   - A reflection meeting at the end of each sprint where the team discusses what went well, what didn't, and how they can improve.
   - The objective is to encourage continuous improvement and foster a culture of learning.
4. Backlog Refinement
   - A session where the product backlog (list of tasks and features) is reviewed and updated.
   - The purpose is to ensure the backlog is well-defined, prioritized, and ready for future sprints, reducing last-minute confusion.

#### How do Agile teams collaborate asynchronously and across time zones?
- Using tools like Jira, Notion, or Slack to keep tasks, decisions, and updates transparent.
- Instead of live stand-up meetings, team members will post daily updates in Slack or a project management tool.
- Assigning clear responsibilities ensures progress continues even if team members work in different time zones.
- Finding common hours for key meetings and discussions.
- Recording important meetings or sharing key takeaways in writing for those in different time zones.

### Reflection
#### How do Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment?
- Ensure transparency by keeping everyone updated on progress.
- Improve collaboration by identifying blockers early and allowing the team to adjust priorities quickly.
- Encourage feedback so the team continuously learns and improves.
- Keep work focused by ensuring tasks align with business goals.

#### Which ceremony do you think is most important for your role, and why?
As a frontend developer, Sprint Planning and Backlog Refinement are the most important because:
- Sprint Planning helps understand upcoming tasks, clarify requirements, and estimate development time.
- Backlog Refinement ensures that tickets are clear, reducing confusion when working on new features.

However, Daily Stand-ups are al valuable for staying aligned with the team and identifying blockers early.
