# Milestone: Working in an agile team
## Agile at Focus Bear

### Research & Learn
#### What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?
Agile project management is flexible and interactive approach that focuses on breaking down into small tasks, collaboration and getting feedback as we go. Unlike tradition project management, where work is planned in advance and follows a linear process, Agile allows for adaptability and frequent adjustments based on real-time feedback.

#### What are the core values and principles of Agile? (Hint: Check the Agile Manifesto.)
The Agile Manifesto is an essential for everyone to read and understand in order to grasp the essence of Agile. Here are some examples its core values and principles.
Values:
- Individuals & interactions over processes & tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.
Principles:
- Deliver working software frequently.
- Welcome changing requirements.
- Encourage collaboration and self-organizing teams.
- Maintain a sustainable pace of work.

#### What are the differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when is each used?
| Feature       | Scrum                                       | Kanban                           |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Structure** | Works in time-boxed sprints (1-4 weeks)    | Uses a continuous flow of work      |
| **Roles**     | Has defined roles: Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Development Team | No fixed roles; team members manage their workflow |
| **Workflow**  | Tasks are committed at the start of a sprint | Tasks are continuously pulled through the workflow |
| **Changes**   | Changes happen after a sprint ends         | Can reprioritize tasks anytime      |
| **Best For**  | Teams working on structured, time-bound projects | Teams needing flexibility and a steady workflow |

#### Why does Focus Bear lean towards Kanban instead of Scrum?
- Continuous improvement: Since work is ongoing, Kanban allows for flexibility without sprint deadlines.
- Adaptability: Focus Bear frequently adjusts priorities, which fits better with Kanban's dynamic nature.
- No strict roles needed: The team can manage work collaboratively without requiring Scrum roles.

### Reflection
#### What do you think are the biggest benefits and challenges of Agile?
Benefits:
- Better collaboration and continuous feedback.
- Flexibility in requirement changing.
- Faster delivery of working sprint.
Challenges:
- Requires strong communication and discipline.
- Managing changing priorities effectively can be challenging.
#### How can Agile principles help improve your role and responsibilities?
As a Frontend Developer, Agile can help me:
- Get quick feedback from designers, QA, and users.
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.
- Improve collaboration by continuously aligning with team members.
- Deliver features faster without waiting for long planning cycles.

### Task
#### Summarise the main differences between Scrum and Kanban in your own words.
Scrum is structured around sprints, with clear planning and roles, while Kanban is a flexible, continuous workflow where tasks move through different stages as needed. Scrum works well when a project has clear deadlines, but Kanban is better for teams needing ongoing adaptability—like at Focus Bear.

#### Identify one Agile principle you think will be most useful in your work.
“Simplicity—the art of maximising the amount of work not done—is essential.”

This principle reminds me to focus on essential features first rather than overcomplicating development. Keeping UIs clean, avoiding unnecessary complexity, and improving efficiency aligns well with my frontend work.
