# Milestone: Working in an agile team
## Roles in an Agile Team

### Research & Learn

#### What are the key roles in an Agile team, and what does each role do?
1. Developers
   - Write, review, and maintain code.
   - Implement new features and fix bugs.
   - Collaborate with QA, PMs, and designer to ensure smooth development.
2. QA (Quality Assurance)
   - Test features to ensure they work as expected.
   - Identify bugs and report them to developers.
   - Automate testing to improve efficiency.
3. Product Manager (PM)
   - Defines product vision and goals.
   - Prioritises tasks and maintains the backlog.
   - Works with stakeholders to align business and technical needs.
4. Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)
   - Facilitates Agile ceremonies (stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospectives).
   - Remove blockers and ensures smooth workflow.
   - Helps teams stay aligned with Agile principles.\
5. Other supporting roles (e.g., stakeholders, UX, customer support)
   - UX Designers – Design user-friendly interfaces and ensure a smooth user experience.
   - Stakeholders – Provide business insights and feedback.
   - Customer Support – Gather user feedback and report issues to the team.

#### How do these roles collaborate in Kanban vs. Scrum?
1. Kanban focuses on continuous delivery and flexible prioritisation.
   - Tasks flow through the board at their own pace.
   - Collaboration is asynchronous, with updates happening when needed.
   - Developers, QA, and PMs continuously refine and move tasks forward.
2. Scrum follows structured sprints with defined goals.
   - Teams work in time-boxed sprints (1-4 weeks).
   - Collaboration happens in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.
   - Developers and QA work closely within a sprint, and PMs prioritize work before each sprint starts.

### Reflection
#### What is your role, and how does it contribute to the Agile process?
As a Frontend Developer, my role is to build and maintain the user interface (UI) of the application. I may collaborate with designers to implement visual elements and ensure smooth functionality, working with backend developers to integrate APIs and data.
I must contribute by:
- Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable frontend code.
- Ensuring UI/UX consistency across the product.
- Fixing bugs and optimising performance.
- Collaborating with QA to test and refine features.

#### How do your responsibilities overlap or interact with other roles in the team?
- With UX Designers: Implement designs accurately while ensuring usability.
- With Backend Developers: Integrate APIs and ensure smooth data flow.
- With QA Engineers: Fix reported bugs and optimise frontend performance.

### Task

#### Write a short description of how your role fits into the Agile team.
As a Frontend Developer, I turn design concepts into functional web pages or applications, ensuring they are responsive, accessible, and optimized for performance. I collaborate with designers, backend developers, and QA to build seamless user experiences.

#### Identify one other role you frequently collaborate with and describe how you can improve teamwork with them.
- Role: QA Engineer
- Collaboration: QA tests the frontend implementation to ensure everything functions correctly and meets requirements.
- How to Improve:
   - Communicate early about potential edge cases to reduce back-and-forth.
   - Write detailed documentation for complex UI interactions.
   - Use automated testing to catch frontend issues faster.
