# Milestone: Working in an agile team
## Agile Workflows & Kanban

### Research & Learn
#### How does a Kanban board work, and how does it help manage workflow?
A Kanban board is a visual tool used to manage workflow efficiently in a project. It helps teams track tasks, prioritise work, and avoid bottlenecks by keeping progress visible at all times. Kanban boards use cards to represent tasks and columns to represent different stages of work. Tasks (cards) move from left to right as they progress.

#### What do the different columns on a Kanban board represent? (e.g., Backlog, In Progress, Blocked, Done)
1. **Backlog** – A list of tasks that need to be completed but are not yet started.
2. **To Do** – Prioritized tasks that are ready to be worked on.
3. **In Progress** – Tasks actively being worked on.
4. **Blocked** – Tasks that are stalled due to dependencies or issues.
5. **Review/Testing** – Work that is completed but needs review before being marked as done.
6. **Done** – Completed tasks that require no further action.

#### How do tasks move through the board, and who is responsible for updating them?
- Team members move tasks from one column to another as they progress.
- Product owners or managers may prioritise tasks in the backlog.
- Developers, designers, or other contributors update the status of tasks based on their work.
- Daily stand-ups help the team track progress and address blockers.

#### What are the benefits of limiting **work in progress (WIP)**?
- Preventing overload by limiting open tasks helps maintain progress and reduces context switching.
- Encouraging focus allows developers to work on fewer tasks at a time, leading to faster completion.
- Reducing bottlenecks enables teams to identify and resolve workflow issues early.
- Improving quality by minimising multitasking results in fewer errors and better overall work output.

### Reflection
#### How does Kanban help manage priorities and avoid overload?
- By visualising tasks, Kanban ensures clear priorities and helps teams focus on what’s most important.
- Work-in-progress (WIP) limits prevent the team from taking on too many tasks at once, reducing stress and improving efficiency.
- Real-time updates allow teams to adjust priorities quickly based on business needs.

#### How can you improve your workflow using Kanban principles?
- Limit WIP: Avoid working on too many tasks simultaneously to maintain focus.
- Update Task Status Regularly: Keep the board accurate to reflect real progress.
- Break Down Large Tasks: Ensure tasks are small enough to complete within a reasonable timeframe.
- Review and Adjust Priorities: Regularly refine the backlog to keep work aligned with business goals.

By following Kanban principles, I can stay organized, reduce task switching, and improve efficiency in my frontend development work.
