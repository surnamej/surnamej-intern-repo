### We want you to think about this personally not just get AI to write a vague answer. Do you know someone with ADHD or autism or even someone without a diagnosis who has struggled socially or to perform well at uni? How might Focus Bear help them?

I don't personally know anyone with ADHD or autism, but I would say my younger brother has struggled with distractions from gaming and online communities. He often found it difficult to complete his tasks. He used to study at university, but his grades were very low, and he eventually had to drop out. If Focus Bear had been available at that time, I would have definitely encouraged him to use the app to stay on track with his homework or read educational books and news. He could still set aside some time to play online games, but he would have been able to manage his time better and balance his activities more effectively.
