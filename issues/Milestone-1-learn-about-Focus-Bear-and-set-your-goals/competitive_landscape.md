# Milestone: Learn about Focus Bear and set your goals

## Understand competitive landscape

### Task: Compare Focus Bear with Other Productivity Apps

Be completely honest in your evaluation—Focus Bear might not always be better than other tools, and that’s okay! The goal is to understand the competitive landscape and think critically about where Focus Bear stands.

Research other productivity and focus apps such as:

- Freedom
- Cold Turkey
- Tiimo
- Routinery

Then, reflect on the following questions:

#### What makes Focus Bear different from these apps?

**Focus Bear** is tailored specifically for neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with ADHD and autism. It offers real-time habit guidance, distraction blocking across devices, and AI-driven focus tools. Unlike other apps that primarily block distractions or track habits, Focus Bear actively guides users through their routines, aiming to reduce decision fatigue and maintain focus.

#### If you were a user, why would you choose Focus Bear over competitors?

As a user, you might prefer Focus Bear if you're seeking:​
- Real-Time Habit Guidance: The app doesn't just remind you of tasks; it guides you through them step-by-step.​
- Comprehensive Distraction Blocking: Blocks distractions across all devices, ensuring consistency in focus .​
- Neurodivergent-Friendly Design: Built with features that cater to the unique challenges faced by individuals with ADHD and autism.​

#### What’s one feature that other apps have that Focus Bear doesn’t?
*Visual Scheduling & Calendar Integration*
Apps like **Tiimo** and **Routinery** offer clear visual timelines and the ability to sync with external calendars like Google or Apple Calendar. Focus Bear doesn’t currently offer this, and for many users — especially visual learners — having a color-coded, timeline-based view of their day helps them better prepare for transitions and understand time allocation.

#### Based on your research, what’s one improvement you think Focus Bear could make?
*Add Habit Streaks & Gamification*
Focus Bear could benefit from introducing gamified habit tracking elements — such as streaks, badges, or daily XP goals — similar to what's available in Routinery and Tiimo. These elements create a sense of progress and reward, helping users stay motivated and consistent, especially those who thrive on dopamine-driven incentives (a common need among ADHD users).
