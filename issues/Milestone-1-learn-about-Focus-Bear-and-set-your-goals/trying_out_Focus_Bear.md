### Reflection Questions
- What was your first impression of the app?

  The app has a clean and minimal interface, which made it feel welcoming at first glance. I appreciated the calming bear theme and the focus on productivity without being too overwhelming. It gave off a friendly vibe that aligns with its purpose ‚Äî helping users stay on track.

- Did you find anything difficult to understand?

  - **Onboarding Flow**: While the welcome screen was straightforward, the purpose of some features (like "habit stack") wasn't immediately clear. A quick tutorial or short explainer videos would help.
  - **Navigation**: Some icons and terms (e.g., ‚ÄúPom‚Äù for Pomodoro timer) might not be intuitive to a new user without prior knowledge.
  - **Settings Overload**: The settings panel had a lot of options, and I wasn't sure which ones were essential to start with vs. advanced tweaks.
  - **Syncing Across Devices**: I wasn‚Äôt sure whether I could use Focus Bear across multiple devices or how syncing works ‚Äî some clarity here would be nice.


- If you had to explain Focus Bear to a friend in one sentence, what would you say?

  Focus Bear is a focus and habit-building app that helps you stay productive by combining Pomodoro-style timers with customizable routines and mindful breaks.
  
- What are some changes that could improve the new user experience?
  1. **Intro Walkthrough**: A guided tour on the first launch would be great to highlight key features.
  2. **Tooltips**: Contextual tooltips or quick definitions for terms like "habit stack", ‚Äúfocus mode‚Äù, and ‚Äúbear lock‚Äù would improve clarity.
  3. **Suggested Setup**: Offer a default starter routine or a template for beginners who aren‚Äôt sure how to begin.
  4. **Progress Tracker**: It‚Äôd be motivating to see a simple ‚Äúyou‚Äôve completed X minutes of focus‚Äù or a streak counter during the first few sessions.
  5. **Better Feedback Loop**: Some prompts or gentle encouragement after sessions would reinforce a positive user experience.
