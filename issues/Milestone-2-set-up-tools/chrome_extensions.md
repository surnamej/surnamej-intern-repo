# Milestone: Set Up Tools
## Set Up Dev Productivity Chrome Extensions

### Install Chrome (or your preferred browser) if not already installed.

### Install the following extensions:
- React Developer Tools (inspect React components).
- Redux DevTools (debug Redux state).
- A JSON Viewer (pretty-print API responses).
- Lighthouse (performance auditing for web apps).

### Research & document your setup in chrome_extensions.md:
#### Which extensions did you install? Why?
- React Developer Tools
  - Allows inspection of React component hierarchies, state, and props in the Chrome DevTools.
  - Usage: Useful for debugging React applications by viewing component structures and state updates.
- Redux DevTools
  - Enables time-travel debugging and state inspection for Redux-managed applications.
  - Usage: Helps track state changes and debug complex Redux flows.
- JSON Viewer
  - Formats and colorises JSON responses from APIs, making them easier to read.
  - Usage: Improves readability of API responses during development and debugging.
- Lighthouse
  - Provides performance, accessibility, SEO, and best practice audits for web applications.
  - Usage: Helps optimize web performance by identifying bottlenecks and suggesting improvements.

#### What was the most useful thing you learned?
- React Developer Tools helped reveal unnecessary re-renders in a component tree, improving performance.
- Redux DevTools showed the importance of action logging to debug unexpected state changes.
- JSON Viewer saved time by making raw API responses easier to inspect.
- Lighthouse emphasised accessibility improvements that were previously overlooked.
