# Milestone: Set Up Tools
## Git Setup & Document Your Knowledge

### Tasks
### Install Git command line tools and verify installation (git --version).
git version 2.46.0.windows.1

### Decide if you want to use a Git client (e.g., GitHub Desktop, Git in VS Code) and set it up if needed.

### Research Git basics and write your reflections in git_knowledge.md:
#### Have you used Git before? If so, in what context?
I have used Git before for version control in Acadmic course projects. It helps track changes, collaborate with team members, and manage different versions of code efficiently. I have primarily used Git for:
- Managing source code in repositories like GitHub.
- Collaborating on projects with multiple contributors.
- Keeping track of commits, branches, and merges.
However, it was so hard at first for beginner user.

#### Which Git client (if any) did you choose? Why?
I have both GitHub Desktop and Git CLI (Command Line Interface) , but GitHub Desktop is my preference because:
- It provides a user-friendly interface, making it easier to visualise branches, commits, and changes.
- It simplifies Git operations like cloning repositories, creating branches, and committing changes without needing to use the command line.
- It integrates seamlessly with GitHub, making collaboration and pull requests more accessible.

However, I also explored the Git CLI (Command Line Interface) for advanced Git commands and finer control over repository management.

#### What was the most interesting thing you learned about Git today?
One of the most interesting things I learned about Git today is interactive rebasing (git rebase -i). It allows you to:
- Reorder, edit, or squash commits before merging.
- Clean up commit history for better readability.
- Avoid unnecessary merge commits by keeping a linear history.
