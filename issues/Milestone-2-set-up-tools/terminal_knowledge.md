# Milestone: Set Up Tools

## Set Up a Terminal Client & Get Comfortable with the Command Line

### Tasks

### Set up a terminal client of your choice (e.g., iTerm2 + zsh on Mac, Windows Terminal + PowerShell, or any other)

### Customize it if desired (e.g., themes, aliases, plugins)

### Research basic terminal usage and write your reflections in terminal_knowledge.md

#### Which terminal client did you choose? Why?

I selected Windows Terminal + PowerShell for my setup.
Reason:

- Windows Terminal supports multiple shells (PowerShell, CMD, WSL, Git Bash) in one window.
- PowerShell provides powerful scripting capabilities beyond standard command-line tools.
- Highly customizable with themes and profiles.

#### What customizations (if any) did you make?

I just use the normal version of its.

#### What was the most useful command you learned today?
