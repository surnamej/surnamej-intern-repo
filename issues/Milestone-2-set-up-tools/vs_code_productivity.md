# Milestone: Set Up Tools
## Set up VS Code and learn keyboard shortcuts
Research VS Code shortcuts and list at least 10 shortcuts that you find useful (multiple cursors are a must have). Categorise them into Navigation, Editing, Debugging, and Terminal Commands.

### Write a reflection:
#### Create a file vs_code_productivity.md and put in your top 10 shortcuts.
**Navigation**
- Go to File → Ctrl + P (Quickly open any file by name)
- Go to Line → Ctrl + G (Jump to a specific line in the file)
- Go to Symbol → Ctrl + Shift + O (Navigate to functions, variables, etc.)
- Switch between open tabs → Ctrl + Tab (Cycle through open files)

**Editing**
- Multiple Cursors → Ctrl + Alt + Click (Add multiple cursors for editing)
- Duplicate Line → Shift + Alt + Down/Up (Copy the current line up or down)
- Delete Line → Ctrl + Shift + K (Remove the entire current line)

**Debugging**
- Toggle Breakpoint → F9 (Set or remove a breakpoint in the code)
- Start Debugging → F5 (Run the debugger)

**Terminal Commands**
- Toggle Terminal → Ctrl + ` (backtick) (Quickly open/close the integrated terminal)

#### Which shortcuts do you think will be the most useful in your daily work?
I believe multiple cursors (Ctrl + Alt + Click), Go to File (Ctrl + P), and Toggle Terminal (Ctrl + )` will be the most useful. These shortcuts help in quickly navigating files, making bulk edits, and efficiently managing the terminal without using the mouse.

#### How can keyboard shortcuts improve your productivity?
Keyboard shortcuts save time by reducing the need for manual navigation and repetitive tasks. They streamline workflows, making coding more efficient and reducing context switching. Mastering these shortcuts will significantly speed up development and debugging processes.
