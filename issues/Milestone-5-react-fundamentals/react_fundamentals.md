- [x] **Reflection (in react_fundamentals.md)**:
  - What challenges did you face during setup?
    Setting up this project on Windows was a great learning experience. I built a React app using Vite and integrated Tailwind CSS v4, and I encountered a few challenges along the way.

    **Adapting to Tailwind v4 Changes:**  
    With Tailwind CSS v4, the old initialisation command (`npx tailwindcss init -p`) is no longer required. Instead, I simply added Tailwind’s directives directly into my CSS file. This new approach simplified the setup but also meant I had to update my workflow and understand the zero-config concept.

    **Ensuring Proper File Imports:**  
    It was crucial to verify that the CSS file containing Tailwind’s directives was correctly imported in the React entry file (`main.jsx`). This step ensured that all Tailwind styles were applied properly. I double-checked my file paths and import statements, which paid off when I saw the live preview with the expected design.

    **Overall Experience and Lessons Learned:**  
    This setup process reinforced the importance of reading the latest documentation and adapting to changes in tools and frameworks. It also highlighted the need to understand the nuances of the operating system you’re working on. Overall, the experience improved my skills in managing modern development environments and gave me more confidence working with React and Tailwind CSS on Windows.

    In summary, while there were minor challenges, the project setup was a valuable opportunity to enhance my technical knowledge and problem-solving skills.
