# Milestone: Debugging

## When to Use Google, AI Tools, or Ask for Help?

### Goal

Develop a strategy to determine when to use search engines, AI tools, or seek help from colleagues during problem-solving.

## Tasks

- [x] Research best practices for troubleshooting coding problems.
  - Spend 30 minutes talking with Chat GPT to understand different perspectives on using AI in coding. When is it helpful and when is it not?
  
- [x] Develop a decision-making framework:
  - Create a flowchart or decision tree in Miro outlining scenarios where each resource (Google, AI tools, colleagues) would be most appropriate.
  - Consider factors such as:
    - The complexity of the problem.
    - The sensitivity of the information.
    - The urgency of the task.

- [x] Export the flowchart and add it to your GitHub repo.

- [x] Write a reflection in help_strategy.md:
  - When do you prefer using AI vs. searching Google?
  
  - How do you decide when to ask a colleague instead?
    I ask a colleague when:
    - The problem involves team-specific logic, architecture, or internal tools.
    - I’ve already spent time trying to solve it myself and need a fresh perspective.
    - The issue is blocking others or impacts collaborative work.
    - I need guidance on code standards, trade-offs, or review.

    Asking for help is not a last resort—it’s a way to collaborate efficiently and avoid wasting time alone.

  - What challenges do developers face when troubleshooting alone?
    - Spending too long in one area of the code without progress.
    - Too many search results or conflicting answers.
    - Unsure whether a fix is correct or idiomatic.
    - Not knowing what question to ask or what terms to search.

    Balancing independent problem-solving with strategic help-seeking is essential for growth and efficiency.

- [x] Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
